        If your child just joined a robotics program, it's time to get excited!
        These student robotics teams are composed of like-minded students
        working together to design, build, program, and drive a competition
        robot. Like athletics and other school activities, competitive robotics
        can give your student real-world experience in communication, teamwork,
        leadership, conflict resolution, and time management. But competitive
        robotics provides students with hands on experience with important
        college- and career-ready skills such as mathematics, physics, computer
        science, technical writing, business management, and more. Studies show <a
          href="#footnotes-talan">[1]</a
        > that participation in educational robotics programs leads to better educational
        outcomes, and increased interest and proficency in important technology skills.
        The competitive aspect of these programs imbues many students with a helpful
        level of structure and internal motivation to develop these skills independent
        of their coursework.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Most teams are affiliated with a school, nonprofit organization, or
        after school program. Students typically meet several times per week
        with their team mates to develop and test their approach to the design
        challenge. Teams showcase their skills at robotics competitions, which
        usually occur on weekends. These competitions are an exciting showcase
        of everything they have accomplished so far!
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Parents and adults serve key roles in these programs, because all
        student teams need some level of behind the scenes support. This support
        includes finding resources for the team, helping them plan out their
        season schedule, and fundraising. Many successful teams often look to
        their adult coaches and mentors for technical advice. You as a parent
        can serve a key role in connecting your child's team with industry
        experts and experienced teams in your local area.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The structure of a competitive robotics season is often vary similar to
        that of other student competitions. The most common competition
        programs, such as the <a href="https://firstinspires.org"
          >First Robotics Competition</a
        > or the <a href="https://roboticseducation.org"
          >VEX Robotics Competition</a
        >, have seasons that last for a portion of year. Each year, these
        organizations release a new design challenge to students around the
        world. Teams will develop their designs, build, prototype, and then
        bring their robot to a local competition.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        At their local regional event, teams will play in matches against other
        teams in the area, ultimately culminating in an elimination bracket to
        determine the event's tournament champion. While at events, students
        typically interview with judges to evaluate their teams performance in
        documentation, soft-skills, and cohesion.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Teams that win certain awards at these events will qualify in their
        State or Regional Championship, which brings together some of the most
        advanced teams from across their region. A regional championship is
        usually structured exactly the same as a local competition, with
        competition matches for the team culminating in an elimination
        tournament.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Teams that do exceptionally well at their Regional Championship will be
        invited to compete at the World Championship, which brings together some
        of the best teams from across the world to determine the World Champion.
        Typically these larger events require fundraising and occur over
        multiple days.
